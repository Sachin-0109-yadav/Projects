# Simple Encryption and Decryption project in C++ 

### What is Cryptography?

 Cryptography is the study of a secure way of transmitting data from person to person, where the data is modified only to be understandable by the intended persons.
In short, if we want to send data or messages securely, then we use cryptographic techniques to avoid the intervention of unwanted persons or systems.

## Code Explanation

In the main function, we are using a switch-case to choose between encryption or decryption.

- In encryption, we are adding an integer to the character so that it changed to the character of the new ASCII value.

- When it comes to decryption, we take the same encrypted text and then change it by subtracting the same integer.

### The main() function : 

   - Declaring the str variable of type ‘char’ to be encrypted or decrypted with a limit of 100 characters.
   - The program will take the string input from the user.
   - The choice of encrypting or decrypting of the string will be given to you.
   - A switch-case control statement is used to select from the Encryption or Decryption case. If selected other than 1 or 2 options then the console will display “Invalid Input !!!”.
